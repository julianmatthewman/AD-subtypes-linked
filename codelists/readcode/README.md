# readcode

Codelists in here were created using the [GetSet interactive codelist creation tool](https://getset.ga) searching the Read V2 terminology (version v20160401).

The search rules are documented in the paper "Term sets: A transparent and reproducible representation of clinical code sets" (10.1371/journal.pone.0212291). Briefly, the search rules are: Case insensitive, Words are matched in any order, All words must be present, Use quotes to match exactly, Wildcards allow partial word searching, Exact matches are never excluded.
